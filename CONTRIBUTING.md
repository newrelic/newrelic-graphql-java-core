#### A note about vulnerabilities  
New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and their data. We believe that providing coordinated disclosure by security researchers and engaging with the security community are important means to achieve our security goals.

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in this project or any of New Relic's products or websites, we welcome and greatly appreciate you reporting it to New Relic through [our bug bounty program](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/security/security-privacy/information-security/report-security-vulnerabilities/).

## Setting Up Your Environment
This Open Source Software can be used in a large number of environments, all of which have their own quirks and best practices. As such, while we are happy to provide documentation and assistance for unmodified Open Source Software, we cannot provide support for your specific environment.

If you can build the project, you can develop it!

## Pull Request Guidelines
Before we can accept a pull request, you must sign our [Contributor Licensing Agreement](#contributor-license-agreement-cla), if you have not already done so. This grants us the right to use your code under the same Apache 2.0 license as we use for this project in general.

Minimally, the [test suite](#testing-guidelines) must pass for us to accept a PR. Ideally, we would love it if you also added appropriate tests if you're implementing a feature!

Please ensure, when making changes to the number or types of fields within the project, that the `toString()`, `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods are also updated.

The easiest way to do this is to autogenerate the methods in the IDE, and when adding a new field, to completely delete the old implementation of the methods and regenerate.

You should not have a need to override or modify the generated boilerplate, but if you do so, you must include a comment that explains why.


## Coding Style Guidelines
Our code base is formatted according to the [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html).

The project is configured to use the [google-java-format-gradle-plugin](https://github.com/sherter/google-java-format-gradle-plugin) which can be utilized as follows:  

* Execute the task `googleJavaFormat` to format all `*.java` files in the project:

`./gradlew goJF`

* Execute the task `verifyGoogleJavaFormat` to verify that all `*.java` files are formatted properly:

`./gradlew verGJF`

## Testing Guidelines

You can run all of the tests, and verify that your code is formatted correctly by running

`./gradlew check`
